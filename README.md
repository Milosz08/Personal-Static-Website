Hello, I'm <a href="https://miloszgilga.pl" target="_blank">Miłosz</a>👋
</h2>

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology. In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of
Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities of communication in a highly distributed
microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in field of real-time communication on
example of chat application ([source code](https://github.com/visphere)).

### 🔬 Field of interest and researching
- processing of real-time video/audio streams in field of QoS (packet loss control, auto-adaptive stream quality),
- multimedia over Internet (live streaming, VoD, IPTV, VoIP),
- web engineering in field of real-time communication,
- distributed data streaming,
- cloud software integration in a broad range of highly scalable and distributed environments (microservices).

## 💎 Technologies
🖥 I'm currently working with:
- JVM (Java, Kotlin, little bit of Scala: Spring and Spring Boot),
- C/C++ (in field of multimedia processing and rapidly fast web services),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Angular, Vue, little bit of React),
- Apache Kafka (distributed data streaming, event-driven architecture),
- microservices (Spring Cloud architecture, AWS),
- Python.

🎓 Besides, during my CS studies I've worked with following technologies:
- .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms, XNA),
- Android (Java Native),
- Jakarta EE and Swing UI (JVM)
- PHP,
- Matlab and Scilab.

👀 Currently learning:
