[The Lorenz Attractor](https://marksmath.org/visualization/LorenzExperiment) -  A 3D space that relates three parameters arising in fluid dynamics. One of the Chaos theory's most iconic symbols that illustrates the phenomenon known as the Butterfly effect, or sensitive dependence on initial conditions - Life, The universe.

**My interests are mainly focused on topics related to multimedia processing, including primarily:**

- selected methods of digital audio and image processing,
- designing real-time audio/video streaming applications for highly distributed environments,
- selected applications of digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision.

**Technologies I'm working with in my current projects:**

- JVM (Kotlin, Java, Scala; Spring and Spring Boot ecosystem),
- C/C++ (JNI, DSP in field of audio modulation and multimedia processing),
- Python (process automation, digital images processing, scientific simulations),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Next.js, React ecosystem; websites and rapid prototyping),
- Message brokers (RabbitMQ),
- DevOps (Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana, Hashicorp Vault, Minio, GitHub Actions, BetterStack).
