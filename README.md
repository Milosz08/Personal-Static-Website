Hello, I'm <a href="https://miloszgilga.pl" target="_blank">Miłosz</a>👋
</h2>

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology. In february 2024, I defended Bachelor of
Science at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities of communication in a microservice
infrastructure using event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka in field of real-time communication on example of
chat application ([source code](https://github.com/visphere)).

### 🔬 Field of interest and researching
My main interests revolve around of real-time communication with a focus on multimedia streaming and system integrations
in a broad range of highly scalable and distributed environments. In particular:

- web engineering in field of real-time communication,
- distributed data streaming,
- multimedia over Internet (processing of real-time video/audio streams, live streaming, VoD, WebRTC),
- cloud software integration in a broad range of highly scalable and distributed environments (microservices).
