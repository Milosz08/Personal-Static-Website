## About me

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology (faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and
Computer Science, spec: Internet and network technologies).

In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities
of communication in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in
field of real-time communication on example of chat application.

Source code you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

## Interests

Major areas of interest:
- real-time web systems in field of multimedia processing and streaming,
- digital image processing (computer vision, biomedical images).

My interests are mainly focused around designing of real-time web applications. In particular, real-time audio/video
streaming systems.

In my spare time, I explore the secrets of digital signal processing, in particular the application of selected techniques of
digital image processing in the field of computer vision and biomedical images.

I am enthusiastic of languages running on the JVM such as Java, Kotlin and Scala, but also more _exotic_ ones such as
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I am proficient in a number of popular programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C#) and to a
greater or lesser extent I know the basics of several other languages (Python, Scala, C++, Matlab) including those
_exotic_ (the aforementioned [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language).

## Technologies

Technologies I'm currently using:

- JVM (Java, Kotlin, little bit of Scala: Spring and Spring Boot),
- C/C++ (in field of multimedia processing and rapid web services),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Angular, React, Astro, little bit of Vue),
- Apache Kafka (distributed data streaming, event-driven architecture),
- microservices (Spring Cloud architecture, AWS),
- Matlab/GNU Octave (digital signal/image processing),
- Python.

Technologies I've used:

- .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms),
- Scilab (circuits simulations),
- PHP (native),
- Android (Java).

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, enthusiast of film music, cinephile, fan of hard science-fiction, horror movies and unconventional
film festivals ([my Filmweb account](https://www.filmweb.pl/user/miloszgilga)).
