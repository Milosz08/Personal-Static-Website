## About me

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology (faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and
Computer Science, spec: Internet and network technologies).

In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities
of communication in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in
field of real-time communication on example of chat application.

Source code you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

## Research interests

My interests are mainly focused on processing and transmitted multimedia over the Internet. In particular, real-time
audio/video streaming in terms of QoS (auto-adaptive stream quality, packet loss control).

In addition to conventional methods of auto-adaptive content streaming, I am deepening my knowledge of predictive
algorithms (based on stochastic processes) and methods using artificial intelligence solutions.

Moreover, I am also interests the integration of large-scale distributed systems using microservices infrastructure and
an event-driven solutions architecture based on Apache Kafka in such systems.

## Technologies

Technologies I'm currently using:

- JVM (Java, Kotlin, little bit of Scala: Spring and Spring Boot),
- C/C++ (in field of multimedia processing and rapid web services),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Angular, Astro, Vue, little bit of React),
- Apache Kafka (distributed data streaming, event-driven architecture),
- microservices (Spring Cloud architecture, AWS),
- Python.

Technologies I've used:

- .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms)
- Matlab/Scilab (digital signal processing, circuits simulations)
- PHP (native)
- Android (Java)

I am currently learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language and gradually getting into functional programming and
developing concurrent real-time web applications.

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, enthusiast of film music, cinephile, fan of science-fiction, horror movies and unconventional
film festivals ([my Filmweb account](https://www.filmweb.pl/user/miloszgilga)).
