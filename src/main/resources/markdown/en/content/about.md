## About me

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology (faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and
Computer Science, spec: Internet and network technologies).

In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities
of communication in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in
field of real-time communication on example of chat application.

Source code you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

## Interests

My interests are mainly focused on topics related to multimedia processing, including primarily:
- selected methods of digital audio and image processing,
- designing real-time audio/video streaming applications,
- selected applications of digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision.

I am enthusiastic of languages running on the JVM such as Java, Kotlin and Scala, but also more _exotic_ ones such as
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I am proficient in a number of popular programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C#) and to a
greater or lesser extent I know the basics of several other languages (Python, Scala, C++, Matlab) including those
_exotic_ (the aforementioned [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language).

## Technologies

Technologies I'm currently using:

- JVM (Java, Kotlin, little bit of Scala: Spring and Spring Boot),
- C/C++ (in field of multimedia processing and rapid web services),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Angular, React, Astro, little bit of Vue),
- Apache Kafka (distributed data streaming, event-driven architecture),
- microservices (Spring Cloud architecture, AWS),
- Matlab/GNU Octave (digital signal/image processing),
- Python.

Technologies I've used:

- .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms),
- Scilab (circuits simulations),
- PHP (native),
- Android (Java).

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, enthusiast of orchestral film music, fan of hard science-fiction, Open Source software and IoT
devices (page you are currently viewing is running on my Raspberry PI 4).
